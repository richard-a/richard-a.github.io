<p><a href="/jmp.pdf">Firm Dynamics and Random Search over the Business Cycle</a></p>

<p><em>Abstract</em>: I develop a tractable model of worker reallocation over the business cycle that emphasizes the interplay between firm heterogeneity and on-the-job search. I use this framework to study the role of search frictions in determining aggregate labor productivity following the Great Recession in the UK. In the model, low productivity firms slow down worker reallocation following the start of a recession because workers stay longer at these firms before making a transition to more productive firms. This channel is consistent with evidence from firm-level UK data suggesting that the allocation of workers to firms has downgraded in the aftermath of the Great Recession.</p>

<p><em>Abstract</em>: Public unemployment insurance (UI) schemes represent an important feature of the social safety net in most advanced economies. However, the self-employed are generally excluded from these programs. This paper calibrates a job search model to US data to evaluate the potential welfare gains from extending UI benefits to the group of self-employed workers. The model features workers in both paid- and self-employment who face the risk of becoming unemployed; it also allows them to privately save to self-insure. Preliminary results suggest that extending UI benefits to the self-employed yields modest, but positive, welfare gains.</p>
