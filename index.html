<p>Firm Dynamics and Random Search over the Business Cycle [<a href="/fdrs.pdf">draft</a>]</p>

<p><details>
    <summary><em>Abstract</em></summary>
    I develop a tractable model of firm and worker reallocation over the business cycle that emphasizes the interplay between firms with heterogeneous productivities and on-the-job search. I use this framework to study the role of search frictions in determining aggregate labor productivity following a large economic contraction. In the model, search frictions slow down worker reallocation after a recession, as employed workers face increased competition from a larger pool of unemployed workers. This crowding-out effect holds back the transition of employed workers from less to more productive firms, thus lowering aggregate productivity. Quantitatively, the model implies that worker reallocation has sizable and persistent negative effects on aggregate labor productivity. I provide evidence for this channel from data on the universe of British firms which show that the allocation of workers to firms has downgraded in the aftermath of the Great Recession.

<p>Self-Employment and Unemployment Risk [<a href="/seur.pdf">draft</a>]</p>

<p><details>
    <summary><em>Abstract</em></summary>
    Though public unemployment insurance (UI) schemes represent an important feature of the social safety net in most advanced economies, the self-employed are generally excluded from these programs. This paper shows that, similarly to traditional wage workers, the self-employed do go through unemployment spells in US data. It then calibrates a job search model to evaluate the potential welfare gains from extending UI benefits to this group of workers. The model features workers in both paid- and self-employment who face the risk of becoming unemployed; it also allows them to privately save to self-insure. Preliminary results suggest that extending UI benefits to the self-employed yields modest, but positive, welfare gains.

<!-- Productivity Spillovers in Knowledge Production (with Michele Giannola)     
<details>
    <summary>_Abstract_</summary>
    Teams of inventors produce more and higher quality research than individuals do. This paper investigates a potential channel for this finding by studying productivity spillovers in the production of new ideas. Using data on over 9.5 million patents filed at the United States Patent Office and the European Patent Office, we investigate whether the productivity of an inventor, measured by the number of patents produced in a year and by the number of citations received, is affected by the productivity of her team members. Our estimation strategy tackles the endogenous sorting of inventors into peer groups and avoids the reflection problem. We find economically meaningful effects: conditional on inventor, firm, sector by year and location by year fixed effects, a one standard deviation increase in the productivity of an inventor’s peers translates into a 23% increase in the number of citations she receives and in a 14% increase in the number of patents she produces. In the second part of the paper, we test whether the combination of scientific specialties allowed by teamwork matters for productivity spillovers. Specifically, we test whether collaborating with peers who have patented in distinct technology fields differentially affects individual productivity. This test provides a potential rationale for the policies promoting interdisciplinarity in research.
