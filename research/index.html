    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Though public unemployment insurance (UI) schemes represent an important feature of the social safety net in most advanced economies, the self-employed are generally excluded from these programs. This paper shows that, similarly to traditional wage workers, the self-employed do go through unemployment spells in US data. It then calibrates a job search model to evaluate the potential welfare gains from extending UI benefits to this group of workers. The model features workers in both paid- and self-employment who face the risk of becoming unemployed; it also allows them to privately save to self-insure. Preliminary results suggest that extending UI benefits to the self-employed yields modest, but positive, welfare gains.

<!-- Productivity Spillovers in Knowledge Production (with Michele Giannola)     
<details>
    <summary>_Abstract_</summary>
    Teams of inventors produce more and higher quality research than individuals do. This paper investigates a potential channel for this finding by studying productivity spillovers in the production of new ideas. Using data on over 9.5 million patents filed at the United States Patent Office and the European Patent Office, we investigate whether the productivity of an inventor, measured by the number of patents produced in a year and by the number of citations received, is affected by the productivity of her team members. Our estimation strategy tackles the endogenous sorting of inventors into peer groups and avoids the reflection problem. We find economically meaningful effects: conditional on inventor, firm, sector by year and location by year fixed effects, a one standard deviation increase in the productivity of an inventor’s peers translates into a 23% increase in the number of citations she receives and in a 14% increase in the number of patents she produces. In the second part of the paper, we test whether the combination of scientific specialties allowed by teamwork matters for productivity spillovers. Specifically, we test whether collaborating with peers who have patented in distinct technology fields differentially affects individual productivity. This test provides a potential rationale for the policies promoting interdisciplinarity in research.
