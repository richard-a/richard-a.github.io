    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Though public unemployment insurance (UI) schemes represent an important feature of the social safety net in most advanced economies, the self-employed are generally excluded from these programs. This paper shows that, similarly to traditional wage workers, the self-employed do go through unemployment spells in US data. It then calibrates a job search model to evaluate the potential welfare gains from extending UI benefits to this group of workers. The model features workers in both paid- and self-employment who face the risk of becoming unemployed; it also allows them to privately save to self-insure. Preliminary results suggest that extending UI benefits to the self-employed yields modest, but positive, welfare gains.
